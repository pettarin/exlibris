exlibris - add a nice ex libris to your EPUB eBook
==================================================

CURRENT VERSION
 exlibris Calibre plugin 1.0.19

LIMITATIONS
 1) Your eBook input file must be "EPUB 2.0.1"-compliant, and your ex libris input file must be "XHTML 1.1 strict"-compliant, otherwise exlibris is not guaranteed to work properly and it might produce an invalid EPUB file.
 2) Currently exlibris includes the additional files (images, CSS, fonts, etc.) using their extension to set the proper media-type field. Please name your file consistently. For example, do not name a JPEG image 'image.svg' but use 'image.jpg' or 'image.jpeg'.
 3) This Calibre plugin was mainly developed under Calibre 0.8.51, but it might work on earlier versions. It works on Calibre 1.x and 2.x.
